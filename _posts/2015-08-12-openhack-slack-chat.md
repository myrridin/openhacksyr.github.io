OpenHack meetups are great, but they only take place once a month. (the 
[2nd Tuesday of every month](/events.html)!)

Wouldn't it be great if you could stay in touch with our awesome group of 
Syracuse developers throughout the month?

Well now you can, by joining our Slack group! (Haven't heard of slack? It's a 
[group chat application](https://slack.com) that is [all the rage these days](http://mashable.com/2015/04/16/slack-valuation/).)

### Why should I join the OpenHack Slack group?

- To learn more about OpenHack Syracuse
- To stay in touch with OpenHack members between events
- To ask programming questions
- To share something you've learned

Check [our slack page](/slack) for details on how to join in.

Hope to see you in slack!
